## Introduction and The Metrics

Our goal for this assignment was to analyze three different datasets and come up with metrics to determine the best neighboorhood in Pittsburgh. 

Raied chose the dataset containing data on all the trees in the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. With this dataset, he was able to analyze the quality of the trees in each neighborhood and the values of the various benefits the trees provide in each neighborhood.

## Raied's Conlcusion

Looking at all the data analyze above, I have concluded that Squirrel Hill North is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. After Squirrel Hill South, it has the second most number of trees out of all the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and the vast majority of them are in good or fair condition. What makes Squirrel Hill North the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh because of its trees is the fact that the trees in Squirrel Hill North provide the highest dollar value air quality, porperty value, and stormwater benefits out of the top 10 neighborhoods with the most amount of trees. 

## Francis's Conclusion

## Yves's Conclusion
In conclusion the best neighborhood by this metric is Squirrel Hill South. This has the highest median age of death which is an indicator of a healthier standard of living and prosperity. Some other close neighborhoods are North Oakland, Banksville, Point Breeze, and Squirrel Hill North.
